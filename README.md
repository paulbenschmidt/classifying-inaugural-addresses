# classifying-inaugural-addresses
For this project, an analysis of American president classification will be conducted based on their inaugural addresses. This will be done with NLP using the tools of clustering, Bag-of-Words, and TF-IDF vectors. In order to avoid having too many classification categories and have similarly-sized amounts of data for each president, we have limited the text sources to the inaugural addresses of the 15 American presidents who were elected for more than one term and gave a second inaugural address.
