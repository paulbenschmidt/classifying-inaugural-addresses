# classifying-inaugural-addresses
An analysis of American president classification is conducted based on inaugural addresses. This will be done with NLP using the tools of clustering, Bag-of-Words, and TF-IDF vectors. In order to avoid too many classification categories while also having similarly-sized amounts of data for each president, we have limited the text sources to the inaugural addresses of the 15 American presidents who were elected for more than one term and gave a second inaugural address.
